📌 𝘛𝘪𝘵𝘭𝘦: 𝐀𝐮𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐮𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐟𝐨𝐫 "𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞-𝐌𝐞 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧" 𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐮𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐚𝐧𝐚

This Project Mainly focuses on Provisioning the Test & Prod Servers automatically using 𝐓𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦 ( IaC Tool ) and Monitoring the finance-me app, as well as nodes using 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐮𝐬 & 𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐚𝐧𝐚 by setting up separate monitoring server.

🔎 𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒋𝒆𝒄𝒕 𝑫𝒆𝒔𝒄𝒓𝒊𝒑𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏: As soon as the developer pushes the updated code on the GIT master branch, the code should be checked out, compiled, tested, packaged and containerized. A new test-server should be provisioned using terraform and should be automatically configured using Ansible with all the required software’s and as soon as the server is available, the application must be deployed to the test-server automatically. The deployment should then be tested using a test automation tool, and if the build is Successful, Prod server must be configured with all the software it should be pushed to the prod server. All this should happen automatically and should be triggered from a push to the GitHub master branch. Continuous monitoring server must be configured to monitor the test as well as prod server using Prometheus and Grafana should be configured to display a dashboard, metrics like:

CPU utilization
Disk Space Utilization
Total Available Memory
Health of nodes etc...
